- No authentication required
- Data is community-contributed and may vary in completeness

## Features Explained

### Nutri-Score (A-E)
- **A (Green)**: Best nutritional quality
- **E (Red)**: Poorest nutritional quality
- Based on nutrients, calories, sugar, salt, etc.

### Eco-Score (A-E)
- **A (Green)**: Best environmental impact
- **E (Red)**: Highest environmental impact
- Considers production, transport, packaging, etc.

### Nutrition Facts
Displays per 100g:
- Energy (kcal)
- Fat (g)
- Carbohydrates (g)
- Proteins (g)
- Salt (g)
- Fiber (g)

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge 87+
- Firefox 85+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers with camera support

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure you've granted camera permissions
- Check that no other application is using the camera
- Try refreshing the page
- Use HTTPS (required for camera access on some browsers)

### Product Not Found
- Verify the barcode is correct
- Some products may not be in the Open Food Facts database
- Try entering the barcode manually

### Connection Issues
- Check your internet connection
- The Open Food Facts API might be temporarily unavailable
- Try again in a few moments

## Development

To run in development mode with auto-reload:

```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development  # On Windows: set FLASK_ENV=development
python app.py
```

## Production Deployment

**Important**: Before deploying to production:

1. Set `debug=False` in `app.py`
2. Use a production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn)
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
   ```
3. Set up proper security (HTTPS, firewall, etc.)
4. Configure environment variables
5. Set up proper logging
